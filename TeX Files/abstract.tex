Allocation of courses to professors is an endeavour common to all universities. Similar processes with the same underlying concept are applicable to other organizations as well. We attempt to automate this process in order to make it fast, efficient and trustworthy. 
\large{\paragraph{}For this purpose, we use the Enumerating Maximum Matchings Algorithm (EMMA) and NetworkX library in python coding language. The technique we employ is that of One-One Maximum Unweighted Bipartite Matchings, by applying appropriate constraints to generate feasible allocations. We then assign Satisfaction Scores to these allocations based on the preference orders given by professors and display them in decreasing orders of Scores.}
\large{\paragraph{} Thus, we present all possible allocations of courses to professors in descending order of preference.}\\ \\
