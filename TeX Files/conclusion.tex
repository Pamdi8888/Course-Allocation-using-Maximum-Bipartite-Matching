\chapter{Conclusion and Future Scope}
\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{} Thus, the code for course allocation optimization has been implemented in python.
\section{Future Scope}
\paragraph{} The concept behind course optimization has many use cases and shows great potential with scope for improvement. This includes :-
\begin{itemize}
 \item Optimizing the code to increase efficiency and generalize it to larger data inputs.
 \item Exploring other algorithms like Hungarian algorithm for weighted bipartite graphs.
 \item Creating a proper application with well defined GUI and easy accessibility.
 \item Implementing CUDA so as to run the program on NVIDIA GPU for higher efficiency and distributing workloads over parellelized GPUs.
\end{itemize}
