\section{PROJECT PLANNING}
\paragraph{}  In the project `Course Optimization', we try to automate the process of course allocation of professors by writing code. The following is a plan we made to implement the same:-
\begin{enumerate}
\item We understood the problem statement, namely, what was given, constraints imposed upon it, and objectives and goals of the project.
\item Total amount of work required on the coding, report, and video presentation fronts was assessed.
\item The work was then divided proportionately amongst the 3 group members so as to maximize productivity in a short time frame.
\item This was determined in accordance with the given deadline, keeping a buffer time of 1 day, and setting milestones for smooth completion.
\end{enumerate}
